# Task 4 – Movie Recommendation System

To build a content-based movie recommendation system using Python.  
It suggests similar movies based on genre similarity using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity, with fuzzy matching for flexible user input.  
This helped me understand how recommendation engines use text-based similarity and vector space models.

## Concepts Used

- TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency)  
- Cosine similarity  
- Fuzzy string matching (using rapidfuzz)  
- Content-based filtering  
- User input handling in Python

## How to Run

1. Open `movie_recommender.py` in any Python IDE (IDLE, VS Code, or Pydroid)  
2. Run the script  
3. Enter a movie title (e.g., The Matrix, Toy Story, Inception)  
4. The system will find the closest match and recommend similar movies  
5. If the title is not recognized, random suggestions will be shown

## What I Learned

- How to build a content-based recommendation system  
- How TF-IDF and cosine similarity help compare movie genres  
- How fuzzy matching improves user input flexibility  
- Basics of applying NLP techniques in recommendation systems
