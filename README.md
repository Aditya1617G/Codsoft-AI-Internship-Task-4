Task 4 

This project is a content-based movie recommendation system built using Python.
It recommends movies based on genre similarity using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity, with support for fuzzy matching to handle user input errors.
This helped me understand how recommendation systems work using vector space models and text similarity.

Concepts Used
-TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency)
-Cosine similarity
-Fuzzy string matching (rapidfuzz)
-Content-based recommendation logic
-User input handling in Python

How to Run
1.Open movie_recommender.py in any Python IDE (IDLE, VS Code, or Pydroid)
2.Run the script
3.Enter a movie title (e.g., The Matrix, Toy Story, Inception)
4.The system will find the closest match and recommend similar movies
5.If the title is not recognized, sample titles will be suggested

What I Learned
-How to build a content-based recommendation engine
-How TF-IDF and cosine similarity measure text similarity
-How to use fuzzy matching to improve user experience
-Basics of applying NLP techniques in real-world Python projects
